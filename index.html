          <h4>ABOUT ME</h4>
          <p>
            I am an experienced professional, recently out of graduate school,
            and looking for what comes next. Most of my career has been in the
            legal world, including time practicing law, conducting policy
            analysis, teaching legal studies, and completing a PhD. I am also
            fascinated by mathematics and computing, and I've recently learned a
            few coding languages and started on several sample projects,
            including this website. For creative pursuits, I'm a writer and an
            electronic music composer, and always have several pieces at various
            stages of development. An experienced meditator and mindfulness
            teacher, I have a passion for personal growth and wellness and for
            philosophy, both Eastern and Western.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            I am an MBTI type INFJ and Enneagram type 4w5. I am thoughtful,
            deliberate, empathic, imaginative, sensitive, and thorough. I thrive
            in contexts that provide a lot of autonomy, emphasize collaboration
            and cooperation, reward innovation and unconvential thinking, and
            require the highest standards of ethical integrity. If you are
            looking to work with someone who has a wide variety of skills, who
            always gravitates towards the big picture, who has a creative mind,
            and who excels with both people and technology, then I might be who
            you are looking for.
          </p>
          <br />
