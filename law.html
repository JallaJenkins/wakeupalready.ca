          <h4>MY JOURNEY THROUGH LAW</h4>
          <p>
            As I was approaching the end of my honours undergraduate degree in
            mathematics and philosophy at Simon Fraser University, I decided to
            turn away from academia and pursue my long standing interest in
            social justice by attending law school. As a result of my LSAT
            score, I recieved a flood of applications from US law schools,
            including, much to my surprise, the highly prestegeous Columbia
            University. Not one to turn away from a challenge, I moved to New
            York City and completed my JD there. In my second year, I was named
            a Kent Scholar, the highest academic honours granted by Columbia.

            While I did very well in law school, the practice of law has not
            been a great fit for my particular personality and talents. I
            struggled to develop a traditional legal career, spending several
            years working as a litigator for the Canadian Department of Justice,
            briefly worked in legal aid, then did a short stint at a boutique
            tax firm. I also spent some years teaching legal studies at Capilano
            University, a small teaching university in North Vancouver.
            Eventually, I returned to academia, and finished my PhD in law at
            the

            in May 2023.

          <p>
            Moving forward, I hope to use my legal education and experience
            working in an innovative, co llabaorative, and intellectually
            stimulating environment that prioritizes helping society and
            producing concrete results.
