        I started with a JD from Columbia University and recently finished a PhD
        in law at the
        <a class="link" href="https://allard.ubc.ca/"
          >University of British Columbia</a
        >. Before that, I cut my teeth working as a litigator for the Canadian
        Department of Justice, along with several positions jobs practicing law
        over the years. I spent some time in legal education as faculty at the
        Capilano Univerity Department of Legal Studies
