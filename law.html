            <h4>MY JOURNEY THROUGH LAW</h4>
            <p>
              As I was approaching the end of my honours undergraduate degree in
              mathematics and philosophy at Simon Fraser University, I decided
              to turn away from academia and attend law school as a way to
              pursue my long-standing interest in social justice. As a result of
              my LSAT score, I recieved a flood of applications from US schools,
              including, much to my surprise, the highly prestegeous Columbia
              University. Not one to turn away from a challenge, I moved to New
              York City and completed my JD there. In my second year, I was
              named a Kent Scholar, the highest academic honours granted by
              Columbia.
            </p>

            <p>
              While I did very well in law school, working as a lawyer
              challenged my personality and talents. I struggled to develop a
              traditional legal career, practucing for several years as a
              litigator for the Canadian Department of Justice, briefly working
              in legal aid, and then doing a short stint at a boutique tax firm.
              I also spent a few years on the faculty of legal studies at
              Capilano University, a small teaching university in North
              Vancouver. Eventually, I returned to academia, and finished my PhD
              in law at the University of British Columbia in May 2023.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              Moving forward, I am looking to move away from the traditional
              legal world and find a new career path that builds on my
              knowlegdge and experience in a way that is compassionate,
              collaborative, and innovative.
