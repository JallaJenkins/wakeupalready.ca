            <h4>MINDFULNESS MEDITATION</h4>
            <p>
              For the past 20 years, meditating has been a central part of my
              life. I have maintained a regular mindfulness meditation practice
              and attended many meditation retreats, including several fully
              silent retreats of one-month of longer. As well, I have taken
              in-depth courses on meditation practice and philosophy and
              recieved mindfulness meditation teacher training. For the past
              several years, I have taught mindfulness meditation courses and
              led meditation groups on a by-donation basis.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              Cultivating a regular mindfulness practice has helped me to
              overcome personal challenges, develop strategies for managing
              stress and anxiety, and become more empathetic and emotionally
              mature. When I interact with others, I am better able to stay
              present and authentic and to communicate directly and
              compassionately. In work, school, and volunteer settings, my
              practice has enabled me to navigate conflicts and high-pressure
              situations with greater ease and groundedness.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              I am always happy to discuss meditation and its benefits, teach
              and lead meditaion groups, or provide individual instruction and
              feedback to anyone who is interested.
